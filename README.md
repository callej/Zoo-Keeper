# Zoo-Keeper
First Kotlin Code - As part of JetBrains Academy Kotlin Course

The two files of interest are:
- **Zookeeper.kt** which implements the Zoo Keeper project in the course
- **Examples.kt** which is a playground for testing out different basic Kotlin code constructs

Thank You JetBrains Academy for a great introduction to Kotlin!
